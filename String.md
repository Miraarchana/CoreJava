*Character set encoding* - [https://www.baeldung.com/java-char-encoding]
Need:
Computer understand any real-world text in any language as 0s and 1s. We need a mapping between real-world text to binary representation.
Set of characters included in a  mapping definition is called as **Charset**.

*ASCII 128-charset** -Encoding scheme
Basically all char is converted into a integer value(32-bit) and it is mapped to a 8-bit binary representation(7 bit is character and 1 bit is set free)
This charset includes ]English Alphabet, digits and special characters.
